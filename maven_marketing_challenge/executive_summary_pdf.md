# Executive Summary: Maven Marketing Challenge

## Business Questions & Insights

### 1. What factors are significantly related to the number of web purchases?

**Analysis:** Correlation analysis reveals the relationship between web purchases and key customer attributes.

**Key Findings:**
- **Income** shows the strongest positive correlation (~0.4) with web purchases, indicating that higher-income customers are significantly more likely to purchase online
- **Total Spend** demonstrates a similar strong positive correlation (~0.4), suggesting that customers who spend more overall also tend to use the web channel more frequently
- **Web Visits** surprisingly shows near-zero correlation (~0.0), indicating that website traffic alone does not translate to purchases without other enabling factors

**Implication:** Web purchasing behavior is driven primarily by customer affluence and overall spending capacity rather than mere website engagement. Marketing efforts should focus on attracting and retaining high-value customers to the web channel.

### 2. Which marketing campaign is most successful?

**Analysis:** Campaign acceptance rates measured across five campaigns (Cmp1-Cmp5) plus the most recent response campaign.

**Key Findings:**
- **Campaign 4** achieved the highest acceptance rate at approximately **0.15 (15%)**, significantly outperforming all other campaigns

- **Campaign 3** demonstrates the lowest performance at approximately **0.07 (7%)**
- Most campaigns cluster in the 7-10% acceptance range, making Campaign 4's performance particularly notable

**Implication:** Campaign 4's approach, messaging, or targeting strategy should be analyzed and replicated. The 2x performance difference versus the weakest campaign suggests significant opportunity for optimization across the campaign portfolio.

### 5. Which channels are underperforming?

**Analysis:** Channel performance measured by purchase volume distribution and conversion metrics.

**Channel Performance:**

1. **Store** - 46.41% share (12,571 purchases) - **Strong performer**
2. **Web** - 33.53% share (9,100 purchases) - **Meeting expectations**
   - 76% conversion rate indicates highly efficient channel
3. **Catalog** - 20.03% share (5,880 purchases) - **Underperforming**

**Key Findings:**

**Catalog Channel (Primary Concern):**
- Captures only 20% of total purchases despite likely similar investment to other channels
- Significantly trails both store (down 26.4 percentage points) and web (down 13.5 percentage points)
- Represents missed revenue opportunity of approximately 5,000-7,000 additional purchases if brought to parity

**Web Channel (Optimization Opportunity):**
- While performing adequately at 33.5% share, the 76% conversion rate suggests strong customer intent
- Near-zero correlation between web visits and purchases indicates **top-of-funnel weakness**
- Traffic acquisition, not conversion, is the limiting factor

**Implications & Recommendations:**

1. **Catalog Channel:** 
   - Review catalog distribution strategy, frequency, and targeting
   - Consider reducing catalog investment and reallocating to higher-performing digital channels
   - Test catalog optimization: better segmentation, personalized offers, QR codes linking to web

2. **Web Channel:**
   - Increase investment in traffic acquisition (SEO, paid search, social media)
   - Current 76% conversion rate demonstrates that customers who reach the site are highly likely to buy
   - Focus on awareness and consideration stages rather than conversion optimization

3. **Store Channel:**
   - Maintain current strategy as the anchor channel
   - Explore omnichannel integration: reserve online/pickup in-store, store-to-web marketing

## Strategic Recommendations Summary

1. **Product Strategy:** Double down on wine leadership while developing complementary categories (meat, fish) through cross-selling initiatives

2. **Campaign Optimization:** Replicate Campaign 4's successful elements across all marketing initiatives to achieve 10-15% acceptance rates consistently

3. **Channel Mix:** Reallocate resources from catalog to web traffic acquisition; maintain store investments as primary channel

4. **Customer Targeting:** Focus acquisition efforts on affluent customers aged 50+ with high spending capacity, as they demonstrate the strongest propensity for web purchases and overall engagement

5. **Web Growth:** Prioritize top-of-funnel traffic generation given the exceptionally high 76% conversion rate among site visitors
